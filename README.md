## **The Problem**  
Munich is full of life and opportunities, but even in a big city, loneliness can creep in. Many people feel isolated and hesitate to join new activities because they don’t want to go alone.  

### **Our Challenge**  
Build a simple, fun way to help people connect and feel part of their community — without the stress of being alone when meeting new people.  

## **Our Solution**  
Meet **Engage**, an iOS app powered by a smart backend using Python’s FastAPI. The app matches people who feel lonely and pairs them up so they can join activities together. This way, no one has to face the awkwardness of showing up alone, making it easier to connect with others.

## **How It Works**

### 1. **Smart Matches to Ease Connections**  
- When you sign up, you share your interests, like hiking, gaming, or cooking, and when you’re free.  
- The app matches you with **one other person** who also feels lonely and shares your vibe.  
- Together, you join a **larger group activity**, where it’s easy to meet others.  

### 2. **DoomDetection to Keep You Moving**  
- If the app notices you’ve been doom-scrolling (spending too much time stuck in endless scrolling), it sends a friendly nudge.  
- The notification invites you to join a **nearby activity** with another matched user.  

### 3. **Find Fun Activities**  
- The app fetches **real-time activities** happening in Munich using the city’s Open Data. From community meetups to yoga classes, there’s always something going on.  
- All you need to do is show up — no need to create or organize anything yourself!  

### 4. **Join Together**  
- Once you’re matched, the app encourages you to connect with your match in-app and plan to attend the **group activity together**.  
- This removes the stress of going to a new place alone.

## **A Typical Day with Engage**  

1. You sign up and share your favorite hobbies and availability.  
2. The app matches you with someone who feels the same way — lonely but ready to connect.  
3. Together, you both attend a nearby **group activity** like a board game night or a pottery class.  
4. You meet new people, share experiences, and leave feeling more connected!

## **The Tech Behind the Scenes**

- **FastAPI Backend**: Handles matchmaking, event recommendations, and user communications quickly and efficiently.  
- **Munich Open Data**: Keeps the activity list fresh and up-to-date with events happening all over the city.  
- **Matching Algorithm**: Pairs lonely individuals based on shared interests, availability, and location.

## **Why Engage Matters**  
Engage doesn’t just help people meet — it helps them feel **comfortable** doing it. By matching two lonely people to join an activity together, it removes the stress of being alone and makes socializing easier and more fun.  

Whether you’re new to Munich, shy, or just looking to get out more, **Engage makes the first step simple**.

Together, let’s make Munich a place where no one has to feel alone.
